# (Acu) COBOL dynamic Arrays library

## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to **provide a usable COBOL implementation of dynamic arrays**.

Unfortunately it is written in **Acu dialect**. Syncerely I completely ignore if it can compile in any other COBOL dialect or not.

However even if not, you can always fork this repo and provide your own.

## Why?

I worked exlusively in Acu COBOL for 4 years consecutively. Unfortunately I discovered that Acu didn't provide any dynamic array implementation.

Actually, as far as i know, no COBOL implementation provide dynamic arrays out of the box.

**So here it is my COBOL implementation of dynamic arrays**.
